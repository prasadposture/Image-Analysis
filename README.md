# Image-Analysis
In this project I have perfomed various operations on image while treating it as a matrix. The library used for the same is known as OpenCV. This library is mostly used for computer vision applications, such as video analysis, CCTV footage analysis and image analysis. I had done this project for 'Data Analytics with Python' course offered by MyCaptain.
